 * @ingroup Digital
 * @version 1

 * http://solarracing.gatech.edu/wiki/Main_Page
 * Note that it is also necessary to add a few lines to a project's .cmd file to enable it to
 * execute quickly from flash. WiFiTest uses a .cmd file modified in this way, so copy it.
 * Also note that it is necessary to include CodeStartBranch.asm in the root directory of all
 * flash-based projects.
